xmppench is a XMPP server benchmarking tool based on Swiften (http://swift.im) and boost (http://boost.org).

The testing scenario is having some active connections, i.e. sending messages to each other as fast as possible, and some idle connections. While sending and receiving those messages, latency is measured.
